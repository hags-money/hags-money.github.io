    <h2>Home</h2>
    <p>My name is Will Hagedorn, I am a Computer Science and Data Science major at UW Madison. 
        This is my first attempt at a website (so be nice). It is a collection of projects and ventures that I enjoy.
        I hope you enjoy as well. Below are some of current work experience and relavent course work.    
    </p>
    
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>My work experience has proven my capabilities in trouble shooting numerous types of hardware on multiple operating systems. 
      Additionally, it shows my aptitude for leadership, and my ability to work independently or as apart of team. Most importantly,
      these roles demonstrate my capabilities and eagerness for learning new skills in various positions, and my ability to
      apply these new skills to problem solve in a number of scenarios.</p>
